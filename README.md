# Hello there! :wave:

I'm **BigEd**, I am a hobbyist backend developer, I specialize mainly in Javascript while also working in C#, C++, and Lua. I also do the occasional frontend work with React/React Native.

> There isn't much to see on here, most of my activity on my actual projects is on private repositories.
